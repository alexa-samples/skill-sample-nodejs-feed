## Setting Up A Lambda Function Using Amazon Web Services

In the [first step of this guide](./1-voice-user-interface.md), we built the Voice User Interface (VUI) for our Alexa skill.  On this page, we will be creating an AWS Lambda function using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).  You can [read more about what a Lambda function is](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda), but for the purposes of this guide, what you need to know is that AWS Lambda is where our code lives.  When a user asks Alexa to use our skill, it is our AWS Lambda function that interprets the appropriate interaction, and provides the conversation back to the user.

1.  **Go to http://aws.amazon.com and sign in to the console.** If you don't already have an account, you will need to create one.  [If you don't have an AWS account, check out this quick walkthrough for setting it up](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/aws/set-up-aws.md).

2.  **Click "Services" at the top of the screen, and type "Lambda" in the search box.**  You can also find Lambda in the list of services.  It is in the "Compute" section.

    <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home" target="_new"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-2-services-lambda._TTH_.png" /></a>

3.  **Check your AWS region.** AWS Lambda only works with the Alexa Skills Kit in two regions: US East (N. Virginia) and EU (Ireland).  Make sure you choose the region closest to your customers.

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-3-check-region._TTH_.png"/>

4. Create an AWS Role in IAM with access to DynamoDB, S3 and CloudWatch logs.

     ![create_role_1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern-public-assets/sample-skill-nodejs-feed/aws-create-role-screenshot-1.PNG "AWS Create Role Screenshot 1")
     ![create_role_2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern-public-assets/sample-skill-nodejs-feed/aws-create-role-screenshot-2.PNG "AWS Create Role Screenshot 2")
     ![create_role_3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern-public-assets/sample-skill-nodejs-feed/aws-create-role-screenshot-3.PNG "AWS Create Role Screenshot 3")

5. Create an AWS Lambda function named MyFeedSkillLambdaFunction.
      * Under "Select blueprint", choose "Author From Scratch".

6. Under "Configure function":
  * Enter "MyFeedSkillLambdaFunction" under "Name".  
  * Choose the role you created above under "Existing role".
  * Change the "Timeout" to 30 seconds, since feeds can become an issue.
  * Leave the defaults for everything else.
  * Note the ARN of the Lambda you've created, which you'll need later.

  * Create an AWS S3 Bucket with the name of your choice. Note, the S3 bucket name you choose must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. Thus you may have to retry with another name in case of a conflict.

      ![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern-public-assets/sample-skill-nodejs-feed/aws-create-s3-bucket-screenshot-1.PNG "AWS DynamoDB Screenshot")

  * **[OPTIONAL]** Create an AWS DynamoDB table named MyFeedSkillTable with the case sensitive primary key "userId".

       ![alt text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7671574/17307587/b80787f2-57ea-11e6-9be2-3df26e8e5947.png "AWS DynamoDB Screenshot")

7.  **Configure your trigger.** Click in the dashed box, and select Alexa Skills Kit from the list.  If you don't see Alexa Skills Kit in the list, jump back to step #3 on this page.

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-6-configure-your-trigger._TTH_.png" />

    Once you have selected Alexa Skills Kit, click the **Next** button.

8.  **Configure your function.** This screen is where we will enter the important parts of our Lambda function.  These values will only ever be visible to you, but make sure that you name your function something meaningful.  "FeedReader" is sufficient if you don't have another idea for a name.

9.  **Select "Upload a .ZIP file" as your Code Entry Type** Then click "Upload" and select the zip file you created with the command above.

10.  **Set up your Lambda function role.**  If you haven't done this before, we have a [detailed walkthrough for setting up your first role for Lambda](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/aws/lambda-role.md).  If you have done this before, set your **Existing role** value to "lambda_basic_execution."

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-9-lambda-function-role._TTH_.png" />

11. **For this skill, you'll need to set up your local environment to run the deployment script.**  

      1. Configure AWS credentials the tool will use to upload code to your Skill.  You do this by creating a file under a ".aws" directory in your home directory.

      2. The file should have the format, and include keys you retrieve from the AWS console:

          ```
          [default]
          aws_access_key_id = [KEY FROM AWS]
          aws_secret_access_key = [SECRET KEY FROM AWS]
          ```

      3.	Setup [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

      4.	Get the code and install dependencies:

          ```
          git clone  https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-feed.git
          cd skill-sample-nodejs-feed/src
          npm install
          ```

1. Configure the Project to Use Your Feed

      1. Open ```/lambda/custom/configuration.js``` file.

      2. Update the following information to configure the skill:

          * appId : Your Skill's Application ID from the Skill you created at https://developer.amazon.com.
          * welcome_message : A welcome message that will be spoken to the user when they open your skill.
          * number_feeds_per_prompt : The number of items the skill will read each time the user invokes it.
          * display_only_feed_title : A boolean flag that determines whether to speak out the title-only or title and summary of the items in your feed.
          * display_only_title_in_card : A boolean flag to decide whether to display a card with the title only or title and summary of the items in your feed.
          * categories : The list of RSS feeds you want to include in your Skill.  Each feed will be treated as a category.
          * speech_style_for_numbering_feeds : Naming convention for each item.
          * s3BucketName : Your S3 Bucket Name
          * dynamoDBTableName : Your DynamoDB Table Name (If not created, the skill will create it.)

      3. A sample configuration :

          ```javascript
          let config = {
              appId : 'amzn1.ask.skill.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
              welcome_message : 'Welcome to Feed Skill',
              number_feeds_per_prompt : 3,
              display_only_feed_title : true,
              display_only_title_in_card : true,
              categories : {
                  'feed name' : 'http://www.example.com/rss-feed.xml'
              },
              speech_style_for_numbering_feeds : 'Item',
              s3BucketName : 'my-feed-skill-bucket',
              dynamoDBTableName : 'MyFeedSkillBucket'
          };
          ```

13. Deploy Your Skill

      1. Go to the ```skill-sample-nodejs-feed/lambda/bin/``` directory and run ```deploy.js``` using Node.

          ```
          npm install aws-sdk
          node deploy.js
          ```

      2. Go to the the ```skill-sample-nodejs-feed/lambda/custom/``` directory and zip all of the files.  Be sure to only zip the files inside the directory, and not the directory itself.   Lambda needs to be able to find the ```index.js``` file at the root of the zip file.

      3. Go to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1) and upload the file to your Lambda function, selecting "Code entry type" as "Upload a .ZIP file".

      4. Click the **Next** button to move to the Review screen.

14. **The Review screen is a summary of your choices.  Click Create Function in the bottom left corner.**  You will need to scroll down to find **Create Function.**

12. **After you create the function, the ARN value appears in the top right corner. Copy this value for use in the next section of the guide.**
